#### Self-hosting

It is not recommended to self-host Mike due to the fact that a lot 3rd party APIs and programs are being used.
It simply would be too difficult.

But if you still want to do that, here's the instructions for hosting mike **locally**:
> Please note that those instructions might be out of date!

##### 1. Setting up the repository:
1. Clone the repository into a local directory.
2. Open a command prompt inside the repositroy directory.
3. Execute `npm install`

##### 2. Setting up RethinkDB:

###### Windows:
1. Create `rethinkdb` directory in the cloned repository.
2. Download rethinkdb from https://rethinkdb.com/docs/install/windows/
3. Extract the downloaded .zip file, and copy `rethinkdb.exe` into the directory created earlier in step 1.
4. Run `rethinkdb.exe` either from a command prompt or by double clicking it.
5. Open http://127.0.0.1:8080/#tables in your favourite web browser.
6. Inside, the `test` database, click `+ Add Table` to add 2 new tables: `guilds` and `users`.
7. Close rethinkdb, or keep it running for starting mike later.

###### Ubuntu:

1. Create `rethinkdb` directory in the cloned repository.
2. Install rethinkdb by following instructions at https://rethinkdb.com/docs/install/ubuntu/
3. Open a terminal in the `rethinkdb` directory created earlier, and execute `rethinkdb`
5. Open http://127.0.0.1:8080/#tables in your favourite web browser.
6. Inside, the `test` database, click `+ Add Table` to add 2 new tables: `guilds` and `users`.
7. Terminate rethinkdb, or keep it running for starting mike later.

##### 3. Setting up Lavalink:

1. Make sure you have java jre installed in your system.
2. Download `Lavalink.jar` from https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink/releases and place it into the the cloned repository folder.
3. Create `application.yml` in the same folder of `Lavalink.jar`
4. Use this template for `application.yml` https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink/blob/master/LavalinkServer/application.yml.example
5. Make sure to set the address into `127.0.0.1` if hosting locally.
6. Change `password` into something different, and write down for usage later in the setup instructions.
7. Change the logging path from `./logs/` into somewhere outside the cloned repository folder.
8. Run Lavalink with `java -jar Lavalink.jar` for starting mike later.

##### 4. Create mike's missing configuration files:

> Those configuration files contain secrets and passwords, and so they are .gitignored by default, make sure to not post those secrets into the public!

1. Browse into `files` directory inside the cloned repository folder.
2. Create `databases.json` with this data:
```json
{
    "main": {},
    "beta": {}
}
```

3. Create `dashboards.json` with this data:
```json
{
    "beta": {
        "https": false,
        "domain": "127.0.0.1",
        "port":"8081",
        "secret": "TODO Dashboard Secret"
    },

    "use": [

    ]
}
```

4. Create `roles.json` with this data: (Replace `YOUR_DISCORD_USER_ID` with your discord user id, which you can figure out by enabling `Developer Mode` then rightclicking yourself and pressing `Copy ID`)
```json
{
  "developers":["YOUR_DISCORD_USER_ID"],
  "contributors":["214858075650260992","324622488644616195", "364056796932997121"]
}
```

5. Create `lavalink.json` with this data: (Replace `YOUR_LAVALINK PASSWORD` with the password you've entered into `application.yml`)
```json
{
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": "2333",
    "password": "YOUR_LAVALINK_PASSWORD"
}
```

##### 5. Gathering API tokens:

Create `tokens.json` in the `files` directory (in the cloned repository folder) and fill it with this template data:
```json
{
    "main": "DISCORD_TOKEN_FOR_MIKE_MAIN",
	"beta": "DISCORD_TOKEN_FOR_MIKE_BETA",
	
    "spotifyID": "SPOTIFY_ID",
    "spotifySecret": "SPOTIFY_SECRET",

    "badosz": "BADOSZ_API_TOKEN",
    "genius": "GENIUS_API_TOKEN",
    "twitch": "TWITCH_API_TOKEN",
    "fortnite": "FORTNITE_API_TOKEN",
